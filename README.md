# Low-Latency Market Simulator (C++)

A high-performance, multithreaded market simulator built in C++ to model order book behavior and trade execution delays.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ§µ Multithreaded order processing using POSIX threads
- ðŸ’¾ File I/O from simulated order streams
- ðŸ§  Custom order matching logic
- ðŸ“‰ Benchmarking with high-resolution timers
- âš¡ ~4x speedup vs. single-threaded baseline (future optimization)

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp             # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ order_book.cpp/h     # OrderBook class
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.cpp/h          # Timer utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ orders_1.txt         # Simulated order stream 1
â”œâ”€â”€ orders_2.txt         # Simulated order stream 2
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile             # Build system
## ðŸ§ª Usage

```bash
make
./market_sim
